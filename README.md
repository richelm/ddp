This is my project submission for DDP.

## Motivation

Understanding linear models can be difficult. This shiny application is designed to help students learning linear models. Through the application interface, students interactively explore building and analyzing a linear model using the mtcars dataset. 

Key features of the application:

1. Variable transmission (am) is inlcuded in all models.
1. Checkbox inputs allow students to select additional variables from the dataset for their models.
1. Model summary and plots are generate for student review.
1. Help tab provides additional application information and explanation of mtcars dataset.


The application is is licensed under the terms of the MIT license. Expand the features for the mtcars dataset or add additional datasets for your students.
